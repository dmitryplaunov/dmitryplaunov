#### Hey! 👋

I'm Dmitry, a data analyst, a self-taught developer and a graduate of a business school.

I worked a lot with `SQL`, `BigQuery`, `Tableau`, `Google Analytics`, `HTML/CSS`, `JavaScript` and many A/B testing tools, but now I'm keen on learning and working more with `Python` and `Django`, mostly by developing web applications.
